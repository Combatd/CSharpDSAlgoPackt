* Trees, Heaps, and Graph Structures

### Arrays and Strings
* What is an array, and what are its strengths and weaknesses
* What is a multi-dimensional and jagged array
* How strings are implemented in C#, and how they are similar and different from the array
* How to address some of the array disadvantages with array lists
* Writing code to search for some element value in an array
